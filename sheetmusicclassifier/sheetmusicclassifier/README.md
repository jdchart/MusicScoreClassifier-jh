# Music Score Classifier

This repository is the model trainer part of the Mobile Music Score Classifier, which is a mobile Android application that takes the live camera-feed and classifies the image in real-time into either music scores, or something else and displays the result in the application. It is part of a set of three tools:

|[Model Trainer](https://github.com/apacha/MusicScoreClassifier)|[Mobile App](https://github.com/apacha/MobileMusicScoreClassifier)|[Manual Classifier](https://github.com/apacha/ManualMusicScoreClassifier)|

# Running the application
This repository contains several scripts that can be used independently of each other. 
Before running them, make sure that you have the necessary requirements installed. Note that there are two versions, depending on the Deep Learning framework you prefer: Tensorflow/Keras or PyTorch.

## Requirements

This application has been tested with the following versions, but older and newer versions of Tensorflow and Keras are very likely to work exactly the same:

- Python 3.6
- Keras 2.2.4
- Tensorflow 1.11.0 (or optionally tensorflow-gpu 1.11.0)

or

- Python 3.6
- PyTorch 1.0

Optional: If you want to print the graph of the model being trained, install [GraphViz for Windows](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html) via and add /bin to the PATH or run `sudo apt-get install graphviz` on Ubuntu (see https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/3210)

We recommend [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or 
[Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as Python distribution (we did so for preparing Travis-CI and it worked). To accelerate training even further, you can make use of your GPU, by installing tensorflow-gpu instead of tensorflow
via pip (note that you can only have one of them) and the required Nvidia drivers. 

## Training the model

`python TrainModel.py` can be used to training the convolutional neural network. 
It will automatically download and prepare three separate datasets for training with
Keras and Tensorflow (MUSCIMA dataset of handwritten music scores, 
Pascal VOC dataset of general purpose images and an additional dataset that 
was created for this project, containing 1000 realistic score images and 1000 
images of other documents and objects). 

The result of this training is a .h5 (e.g. mobilenetv2.h5) file that contains the trained model.

_Troubleshooting_: If for some reason the download of any of the datasets fails, stop the script, remove the partially
downloaded file and restart the script.

## Using a trained model for inference
You can download a trained model from [here](https://github.com/apacha/MusicScoreClassifier/releases).

To classify an image, you can use the `TestModel.py` script and call it like this: `python TextModel.py -c mobilenetv2.h5 -i image_to_classify.jpg`

```

```
"/Users/jacob/Documents/Git Repos/MusicScoreClassifier-jh/venv/bin/python" "/Users/jacob/Documents/Git Repos/MusicScoreClassifier-jh/ModelGenerator-tensorflow/TestModel.py" -c "/Users/jacob/Documents/Git Repos/MusicScoreClassifier-jh/model/mobilenetv2.h5" -i "/Users/jacob/Documents/Git Repos/MusicScoreClassifier-jh/input/not-a-score.jpeg"
```

## Exporting the Model for being used in Tensorflow

Since the Android App only uses Tensorflow, the resulting Keras model (despite having a tensorflow model inside)
has to be exported into a Protobuf file. This is a bit cumbersome, because Tensorflow separates between
the model description and the actual weights. To get both of them into one file, one has to freeze the model.

`python ExportModelToTensorflow.py --path_to_trained_keras_model vgg.h5` will take the file `vgg.h5` and create
 a file called `output_graph.pb` that is ready to be used in the Android application.

# Additional Dataset
If you are just interested in the additional dataset that was created for this project,
it can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/apacha/MusicScoreClassifier/releases/download/v1.0/MusicScoreClassificationDataset.zip).
